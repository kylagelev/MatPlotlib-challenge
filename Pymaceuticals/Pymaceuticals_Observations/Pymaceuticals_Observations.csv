Observations
"1. It appears that Capomulin and Ramicane had seen the lowest tumor growth of the four treatments looked at. Although we see this, a better analysis would be given through looking at initial tumor size to final size. This would provide a means to assess whether the treatments work better in smaller sizes or large sizes of tumors at the start."
"2. The Capomulin unique mouse (specifically l509) across timepoints lineplot is a great example of looking at the efficacy of the treatment. It describes how at a particular timepoint the treatment was less effective, while earlier on it worked very well and lowered tumor size. The question, though, drawn from this data is why did the treatment become less effective? This dataset could be comparied to other mice who received the same treatment to assess whether it might be tumor size, weight of mouse, or even gender."
"3. Using the scatterplot that details average tumor size and weight provides insight on the positive correlation between weight and tumor size. The scatterplot, however, can be adjusted to include timepoints and see if weight decreased or increased with treatment attempts to see if there are any potential side effects to treatment that cause weightloss, etc. Along with this, it would be beneficial to also use a legend and compare the treament regimens as well."
